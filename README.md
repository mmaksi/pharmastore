# PHARMASTORE

As a student of pharmacology with entrepreneurial mindset, I
decided to change my local market forever. I found a problem
in my local market - pharmaceutical companies pay huge
amount of salaries for sales representatives in order to
physically collect data from pharmacies by sales
representatives to know what drugs these pharmacies need so
that those representatives can report back to the stores
managers. PHARMASTORE is a an online software solution that
will sit on each pharmacy's computer so that the pharmacist
will be able to order drugs from the store directly without
the need of any sales representative. This MERN stack app
uses the power of React, Redux, Redux Thunk, MongoDB
database, Node.js and Express.js to solve a real-life
problem. I am willing to change my local market forever.
